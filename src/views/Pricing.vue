      Web and app development services are charged at $70/hr. All projects will

      Any charges above the initial estimate will be submitted for your approval
      before work is initiated. We will always strive to thoroughly collect
      requirements before project initiation so that you receive a complete
      estimate; however, requirement changes during project work may result in
      additional charges.

      We offer full management of web app and mobile app hosting and will pass

      supported via simple annual maintenance agreements that may be less than

      hosting fees).

      Contracts

    <p class="mt-4 mb-4 text-l">
      Our initial statement of work (SOW) agreements bind both parties to
      non-disclosure regarding confidential information, state estimated project
      time and price, describe hosting and support deliverables and pricing and
      outline ownership rights of digital assets. While our SOW agreement
      describes all of this in what we believe to be sufficient detail, we are
      happy to discuss additional contract requirements based on your needs.
