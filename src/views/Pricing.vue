        Web and app development services are charged at $70/hr. All projects
        will be scoped prior to initiation and an estimate provided for your
        approval. Any charges above the initial estimate will be submitted for
        your approval before work is initiated. We will always strive to
        thoroughly collect requirements before project initiation so that you
        receive a complete estimate; however, requirement changes during project
        work may result in additional charges.
      </p>

      <p class="mt-4 mb-4 md:text-l sm:text-sm">
        We offer full management of web app and mobile app hosting and will pass
        through hosting charges to you with no markup. We will strive to find
        the most cost-efficient hosting services for you, in all cases starting
        with solutions that have no cost, however hosting costs will depend upon
        your application requirements, the amount of data uses in both content
        and databases as well as data transfer. In most cases, web and mobile
        apps are supported via simple annual maintenance agreements that start
        at $99/year for basic web sites / apps and mobile apps (not including
        hosting fees).

        Our initial statement of work (SOW) agreements bind both parties to
        non-disclosure regarding confidential information, state estimated
        project time and price, describe hosting and support deliverables and
        pricing and outline ownership rights of digital assets. While our SOW
        agreement describes all of this in what we believe to be sufficient
        detail, we are happy to discuss additional contract requirements based
        on your needs.
